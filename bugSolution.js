The solution involves carefully checking and updating dependencies. 

1. **Check `package.json`:** Ensure that all libraries are compatible with the Expo SDK version specified in your `expo.json` file. Refer to the library's documentation to find its compatibility range.
2. **Update Dependencies:** Run `expo install` or `npm install` to install or update any missing or outdated libraries. Use `expo upgrade` to check for and apply the latest Expo SDK updates.
3. **Clean the project:** Delete the `node_modules` directory and the `ios` and `android` folders. Then run `expo prebuild` or `expo start` again.
4. **Examine logs closely:** Although Expo errors are sometimes vague, carefully review the entire log output from the terminal during build or start. Look for any additional hints or error codes that indicate specific problems.
5. **Specify SDK version:** Ensure your `expo.json` file correctly defines your targeted Expo SDK version.  
6. **Check for peer dependencies:** Pay attention to `peerDependencies` in your `package.json`.  Mismatched peer dependencies can also lead to these build issues.
