This repository demonstrates a common yet frustrating issue in Expo CLI projects.  The problem arises from subtle incompatibilities between the Expo SDK version and third-party libraries or project configurations. While the error messages are often unhelpful, the root cause is usually a version mismatch that prevents successful building or starting of the application.  The example showcases how such issues manifest and how they can be addressed using dependency management and SDK upgrades.  The `bug.js` file represents a project with this incompatibility, and `bugSolution.js` demonstrates a solution.
