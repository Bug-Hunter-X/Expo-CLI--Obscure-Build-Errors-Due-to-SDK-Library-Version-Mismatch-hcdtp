This error occurs when using Expo CLI and attempting to run a project that utilizes a library or feature incompatible with the current Expo SDK version.  The error message might not be very specific, often pointing towards a general issue during build or start-up. For instance, you might see errors related to missing modules or native code compilation failures even if the modules appear correctly installed in your `package.json`.
